### About Me

I will be a PhD student in Mathematical Sciences at Rutgers University Newark working with [Prof. Patrick Shafto](https://patrickshafto.com/) at [Shafto Lab](https://shaftolab.com/) starting from August 2024. <br/>
<br/>
Currently, I am working on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning under sequential social dilemmas with Dr. Taro Toyoizumi at [Lab for Neural Computation and Adaptation](https://toyoizumilab.riken.jp/) at [RIKEN Center for Brain Science](https://cbs.riken.jp/en/) since May 2022. <br/>
Additionally, I am working on fMRI data analysis with [Dr. Junichi Chikazoe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jlB0TpIAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Araya Inc.](https://research.araya.org/) since December 2021. <br/>
Prior to that, I studied for an MS in Statistics and worked as a Teaching Assistant at Miami University from August 2019 to May 2021. I received my BS in Mathematics from Ohio Northern University in 2019.
