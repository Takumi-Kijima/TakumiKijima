### About Me

I am a PhD student in Mathematical Sciences at Rutgers University Newark working with [Prof. Patrick Shafto](https://patrickshafto.com/) at [Shafto Lab](https://shaftolab.com/) since Aug. 2024.  <br/>
<br/>
Formerly, I had worked on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning under sequential social dilemmas with Dr. Taro Toyoizumi at [Lab for Neural Computation and Adaptation](https://toyoizumilab.riken.jp/) at [RIKEN Center for Brain Science](https://cbs.riken.jp/en/) from May 2022 to Aug. 2024.  <br/>
Additionally, I had worked on fMRI data analysis with [Dr. Junichi Chikazoe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jlB0TpIAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Araya Inc.](https://research.araya.org/) from Dec. 2021 to Aug. 2024.  
<br/>
Prior to that, I had studied for an MS in Statistics and worked as a Teaching Assistant at Miami University from Aug. 2019 to May 2021. I received my BS in Mathematics from Ohio Northern University in 2019.
